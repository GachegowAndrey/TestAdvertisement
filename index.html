   <h2>RightInformation</h2>
 <p>Encountered on Bitterblack Isle,
   these undead dragons from origins unknown bear a striking visual similarity to a near death Ur-Dragon, </br>
   however Cursed Dragons are smaller and less powerful. Instead of a heart, they have a single purple crystal in their chest,</br>
   which the Cursed Dragon accompanying the Dark Bishop also lacks.</br>
They breathe a vile and foul gas, which can inflict multiple debilitations and rots any time sensitive items in the party's inventory.</br>
Like the Ur-Dragon, the Cursed Dragon can be slain by a pawn if they strike the final blow to its crystal.</p>

 <h2>LeftInformation</h2>
<p> Death is a shadowy figure shrouded in black found on Bitterblack Isle. </br>
  Larger than many creatures in the realm, it hovers ominously above the ground.</br>
  Death's hood hides no facial featuresâ€”instead, only a gaping black hole looks back at the Arisen.</br>
  Its deadly scythe, larger than its own body, will instantly kill even the mightiest adventurers.</br>
  The Bone Lantern held in its left hand allows him to cast Sleep.</p>
